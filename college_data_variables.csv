Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort (D150_4, D150_L4). For full-time, first-time, bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates, 150 percent of normal time is typically 6 years, and for full-time, first-time, associate's degree-seeking undergraduates it is typically 3 years. For full-time, first-time, certificate-seeking undergraduates, the normal time period varies by the length of the program (for example, 9 months for a certificate with a normal completion time of 6 months).

It is calculated from values in the IPEDS Institutional Characteristics and Student Financial Aid components. Separate metrics are calculated for academic-year institutions and program-year institutions. For academic-year institutions, average cost of attendance represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), average cost of attendance represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution, and it includes full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year.
